Many years passed, and the old Victorian house in Arkham stood as a somber reminder of the tragedy that had unfolded within its walls. The Lovecraftian-style wardrobe remained a silent sentinel in the attic, its dark secrets hidden from the world.

Then, one fateful day, the wardrobe stirred once more. With a shuddering groan, its doors creaked open, and from within emerged the lifeless bodies of Eliza and Samuel. Their forms were pale and ethereal, their eyes empty and devoid of life.

Word spread quickly through the town of Arkham, and soon, relatives and loved ones gathered to witness the bittersweet reunion. Tears flowed freely as they tenderly cradled the lifeless bodies of Eliza and Samuel, their hearts heavy with grief and longing.

Together, they carried the bodies to a nearby cemetery, where a solemn burial ceremony was held. Amidst the mournful wails of loved ones, Eliza and Samuel were laid to rest, their bodies returning to the earth from which they had come.

As the final clods of dirt were placed upon their graves, a sense of closure settled upon the gathered mourners. The tragic tale of Eliza and Samuel had reached its conclusion, their souls finally at peace after years of wandering in the cosmic abyss.

And as the sun set on the horizon, casting a golden glow upon the cemetery, the Lovecraftian-style wardrobe stood silent and still, its dark secrets forever entombed within its wooden confines. The town of Arkham would never forget the tragedy that had unfolded within its walls, but with the passing of time, the memory of Eliza and Samuel would become a bittersweet echo of a bygone era.
